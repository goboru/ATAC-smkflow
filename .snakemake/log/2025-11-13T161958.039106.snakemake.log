MissingOutputException in rule multiqc in file /media/scratch/gborrego/AB_Multiomics_CD14_CD4/scripts/everlook_pipeline/ATAC_pipeline.smk, line 43:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/gborrego/gborrego/AB_Multiomics_CD14_CD4/data/clean/qc_untrimmed/multiqc_report.html
Shutting down, this might take some time.
